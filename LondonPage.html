            <h1>London's Page</h1>
            <p>London has always been a favorite city of mine,
            but living there really cemented this feeling. It is 
            the most lively city I have ever lived in and so many 
            different areas, each with their own personalities. I 
            lived in East London, a bright and artisitic area. 
            Street art and vintage shops were huge. My favorite 
            weekend event was heading to Brick Lane to look at 
            different market tents, get a beigel and stop in a 
            coffee shop. During the week, I enjoyed shopping on 
            busy Oxford Street or heading to Camden Market for 
            a treat. When visitors came to stay with me, I 
            always brought them to afternoon tea in Hyde Park.
            Here is a <a href="https://www.blakemorehydepark.com/dining/afternoon-tea/">link</a>
            to the hotel I went to. I loved it!</p>
