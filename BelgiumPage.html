            <h1>Belgium's Page</h1>
            <p>I spent three days in Belgium, each day in a different city!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Brussels</li>
                <li>Brugge</li>
                <li>Antwerp</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There was so much to see and do in each of
                these wonderful cities! In Brussels I 
                enjoyed great waffles, mussels, and fries. In Brugge
                I sampled the best chocolate I've ever had
                and in Antwerp I saw the most beautiful
                diamonds in the world! It was a great 
                country to go to and very easy to travel
                by train each day. I definitely recommend
                stopping in Belgium at some point 
                in your life!
